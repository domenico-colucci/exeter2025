            if your prediction is correct, you will receive favourable rounding treatment: 
            this means that if your prediction is, e.g. 25 and your actual mark is within 25 and 25.5
            you will receive a mark of 26. <br>Notice: in normal circumstances,
            this rounding treatment is not applied, so you would receive a mark of 25.
            <br>You will also be helping research.
